      "heat transfer": `## Heat Transfer Analysis

### Problem Identification
The problem involves heat transfer calculations for ${prompt.includes("exchanger") ? "a heat exchanger" : "heating equipment"}.

### Step 1: Determine the Heat Transfer Requirements
- Calculate the heat duty required: Q = m × Cp × ΔT
- For this problem: Calculate the heat required to change the temperature from initial to final conditions

### Step 2: Calculate Heat Transfer Parameters
- Determine the logarithmic mean temperature difference (LMTD)
- LMTD = (ΔT₁ - ΔT₂) / ln(ΔT₁/ΔT₂)
- Where ΔT₁ and ΔT₂ are the temperature differences at each end of the exchanger

### Step 3: Determine Heat Transfer Coefficient
- Overall heat transfer coefficient (U) estimation based on fluid properties
- Calculate the required heat transfer area: A = Q / (U × LMTD)

### Step 4: Evaluate Heat Exchanger Performance
- Calculate the effectiveness using the NTU method
- Effectiveness = Actual heat transfer / Maximum possible heat transfer
- NTU = UA / (m × Cp)min

### Step 5: Check Fouling and Efficiency
- Account for fouling factors in the overall heat transfer coefficient
- Evaluate performance over time with fouling effects

### Detailed Example: Counter-current Heat Exchanger Design

#### Given Data:
- Hot fluid: 10,000 kg/h of oil (Cp = 2.1 kJ/kg·K)
- Cold fluid: 15,000 kg/h of water (Cp = 4.18 kJ/kg·K)
- Hot fluid inlet temperature: 120°C
- Hot fluid outlet temperature: 70°C
- Cold fluid inlet temperature: 25°C
- Cold fluid outlet temperature: 55°C
- Overall heat transfer coefficient: 500 W/m²·K

#### Step 1: Calculate the heat duty
Q = mₕ × Cpₕ × (Tₕ₁ - Tₕ₂)
Q = (10,000 kg/h) × (2.1 kJ/kg·K) × (120°C - 70°C) / 3600 s/h
Q = 291.67 kW

#### Step 2: Calculate LMTD
ΔT₁ = Tₕ₁ - Tc₂ = 120°C - 55°C = 65°C
ΔT₂ = Tₕ₂ - Tc₁ = 70°C - 25°C = 45°C
LMTD = (65°C - 45°C) / ln(65°C / 45°C) = 54.17°C

#### Step 3: Calculate required heat transfer area
A = Q / (U × LMTD)
A = 291.67 kW / (0.5 kW/m²·K × 54.17°C)
A = 10.77 m²

#### Step 4: Calculate NTU and effectiveness
Cₕ = mₕ × Cpₕ = (10,000 kg/h) × (2.1 kJ/kg·K) / 3600 s/h = 5.83 kW/K
Cc = mc × Cpc = (15,000 kg/h) × (4.18 kJ/kg·K) / 3600 s/h = 17.42 kW/K
Cmin = 5.83 kW/K (hot fluid)
Cr = Cmin/Cmax = 5.83/17.42 = 0.335

NTU = U × A / Cmin = 0.5 kW/m²·K × 10.77 m² / 5.83 kW/K = 0.923

For counter-current flow with Cr = 0.335:
ε = [1 - exp(-NTU × (1 - Cr))] / [1 - Cr × exp(-NTU × (1 - Cr))]
ε = [1 - exp(-0.923 × (1 - 0.335))] / [1 - 0.335 × exp(-0.923 × (1 - 0.335))]
ε = 0.557 or 55.7%

#### Step 5: Verification
Qmax = Cmin × (Tₕ₁ - Tc₁) = 5.83 kW/K × (120°C - 25°C) = 553.85 kW
Qactual = ε × Qmax = 0.557 × 553.85 kW = 308.5 kW ≈ 291.67 kW (calculated in step 1)

The small difference (5.8%) is due to rounding in calculations.`,

      "fluid flow": `## Fluid Flow Analysis

### Problem Identification
The problem involves fluid flow calculations ${prompt.includes("pipe") ? "in a piping system" : "in process equipment"}.

### Step 1: Determine Flow Regime
- Calculate Reynolds number: Re = ρvD/μ
- Classify flow as laminar (Re < 2300) or turbulent (Re > 4000)

### Step 2: Calculate Friction Factor
- For laminar flow: f = 64/Re
- For turbulent flow: Use Moody diagram or Colebrook equation
- f = 0.0625 / [log(ε/3.7D + 5.74/Re^0.9)]²

### Step 3: Calculate Pressure Drop
- Use Darcy-Weisbach equation:
- ΔP = f × (L/D) × (ρv²/2)
- Account for fittings and other minor losses

### Step 4: Evaluate System Performance
- Calculate required pump head: H = ΔP/(ρg)
- Determine pump power requirements: P = ṁgH/η

### Step 5: Check Flow Distribution and Balance
- For multiple paths, equalize pressure drops
- Verify flow rates meet process requirements

### Detailed Example: Water Flow in a Pipe System

#### Given Data:
- Fluid: Water at 20°C (ρ = 998 kg/m³, μ = 0.001 Pa·s)
- Pipe: Carbon steel, 3-inch schedule 40 (D = 0.0779 m, ε = 4.5×10⁻⁵ m)
- Flow rate: 50 m³/h
- Pipe length: 100 m
- Fittings: 5 elbows (90°), 2 gate valves (fully open)

#### Step 1: Calculate velocity and Reynolds number
v = Q/(π×D²/4) = (50 m³/h)/(π×(0.0779 m)²/4) × (1/3600) h/s = 2.92 m/s
Re = ρvD/μ = 998 kg/m³ × 2.92 m/s × 0.0779 m / 0.001 Pa·s = 2.27×10⁵
Since Re > 4000, the flow is turbulent.

#### Step 2: Calculate relative roughness and friction factor
Relative roughness = ε/D = 4.5×10⁻⁵ m / 0.0779 m = 5.78×10⁻⁴
Using Colebrook-White equation (iteratively solved):
f = 0.0185

#### Step 3: Calculate straight pipe pressure drop
ΔP_pipe = f × (L/D) × (ρv²/2)
ΔP_pipe = 0.0185 × (100/0.0779) × (998×2.92²/2)
ΔP_pipe = 109,700 Pa or 109.7 kPa

#### Step 4: Calculate minor losses from fittings
K values:
- Each 90° elbow: K = 0.75
- Each gate valve (fully open): K = 0.17
Total K = 5×0.75 + 2×0.17 = 4.09

ΔP_minor = K × (ρv²/2)
ΔP_minor = 4.09 × (998×2.92²/2)
ΔP_minor = 17,500 Pa or 17.5 kPa

#### Step 5: Calculate total pressure drop and pump requirements
ΔP_total = ΔP_pipe + ΔP_minor = 109.7 + 17.5 = 127.2 kPa

Pump head = ΔP_total/(ρg) = 127,200 Pa / (998 kg/m³ × 9.81 m/s²) = 13.0 m

Hydraulic power = ρgQH = 998 × 9.81 × (50/3600) × 13.0 = 1,774 W

Assuming pump efficiency of 70%:
Pump power = 1,774 W / 0.7 = 2,534 W or 2.53 kW`,
